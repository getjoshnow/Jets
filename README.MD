### Welcome

### Overview
This program reads a fleet of jets with different capabilities from a text file.
The application prompts the user with a menu to access information about the jets on file.
There is an option to add a jet to the fleet. The user can input a name, speed, range and price.
Thank you for using this application.

### Jets Application
Week 3 homework for Skill Distillery Java bootcamp. Jets Application is a database-like designed for the user to view, sort, modify and add file of Jets
for record keeping.

### Technologies Used
Java
Eclipse
Atom
Git
Terminal

### Lessons Learned
This program taught me many design to features associated with Object Oriented programming. The approach involved creating class and Objects as a solid foundation proved to be a challenge of approach, at first until learned that by encapsulation data, and structuring data, that I can create programs much faster than if I
sole did procedure programming.  Utilizing the strengths of Object Oriented Programming allowed me quickly and confidently build foundation.   This was truly a fun challenge, as today, I truly felt I switched from procedure programming to Object Oriented Programming.

### Attack Plan
Building upon UML diagram given, my first approach was to find the most challenging structures of the UML to identify the classes, methods, and variables that I should research in greater depth. I truly believe a little preparation goes a long way, and I ultimately took advantage of inheritance, & classes minimize the code I wrote. Ensuring functionality and formatting were utmost priority. Once I have a good understanding of BufferedReader and FileReader, I developed a file structure to meet the parameters and that the program could read in order to ensure I meet all the requirements and functionality was maintained.   

### Wish List Additions
I did develop a plan of attack for implementing Bomber Jets, Attack planes, such as the A-10 Warthog, and Nuclear capable planes.  Expanding the class and adding menu options would have been a pleasure to see how large this data program could have developed.
